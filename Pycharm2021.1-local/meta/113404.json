{"id":113404,"xmlId":"Key Promoter X","name":"Key Promoter X","description":"\nThe Key Promoter X helps you to learn essential shortcuts while you are working.\nWhen you use the mouse on a button inside the IDE, the Key Promoter X shows you the keyboard shortcut that you\nshould have used instead. This provides an easy way to learn how\nto replace tedious mouse work with keyboard keys and helps to transition to a faster, mouse free development.\nThe Key Promoter X tool window shows you a hit-list of the mouse actions you use the most and directly provides you\nwith the shortcut you can use instead. For buttons that don't have a shortcut, the Key Promoter X prompts you with\nthe possibility to directly create one.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sponsors</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://sponsorlink.codestream.com/?utm_source=jbmarket&amp;utm_campaign=keypromoterx&amp;utm_medium=banner\" title=\"Try CodeStream\">\n    <strong>CodeStream</strong>:\n</a>\n\nRequest and perform code reviews from inside your IDE.\nReview any code, even if it's a work-in-progress that hasn't been committed yet, and use jump-to-definition,\nyour favorite keybindings, and other IDE tools.\n<a href=\"https://sponsorlink.codestream.com/?utm_source=jbmarket&amp;utm_campaign=keypromoterx&amp;utm_medium=banner\" title=\"Try CodeStream\">You\n    can try it for free!</a>\n<br>\n<br>\nI'd also like to give a big thanks to all GitHub sponsors.\nI dearly appreciate all the support for the project.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/halirutan\">Become a GitHub Sponsor</a> |\n<a href=\"https://github.com/halirutan/IntelliJ-Key-Promoter-X\">Repository</a> |\n<a href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/slack\">#key-promoter-x on Slack</a> |\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/halirutan/\">LinkedIn</a> |\n<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/halirutan\">Twitch</a>\n\n","organization":"Hal's Corner","tags":["Apps, Notification and Interaction Applications"],"vendor":"Hal's Corner","version":"2021.1.1","notes":"<ul><li>Update build system and use ideas from the\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template\">IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template repository</a></li><li>Implement resizable split-pane and scroll-panes for Key Promoter tool window\n  (<a href=\"https://github.com/halirutan/IntelliJ-Key-Promoter-X/issues/72\">Issue 72</a>)</li><li>Support recent IntelliJ Platform 2021\n  (<a href=\"https://github.com/halirutan/IntelliJ-Key-Promoter-X/issues/77\">Issue 77</a>)</li><li>Make message for disabling a single shortcut alert clearer\n  (<a href=\"https://github.com/halirutan/IntelliJ-Key-Promoter-X/issues/75\">Issue 75</a>)</li></ul>","dependencies":["com.intellij.modules.lang"],"since":"203.5981.155","until":"211.*","sourceCodeUrl":"https://github.com/halirutan/IntelliJ-Key-Promoter-X","size":51466}
