are ignored.\n","tags":["Code tools","Editor"],"vendor":"FWDekker","version":"2.7.0","notes":"<b>Breaking changes</b>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Minimum IDE version has been increased to 2020.1.\n        (<a href=\"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/issues/209\">#209</a>,\n         <a href=\"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/pull/345\">#345</a>,\n         <a href=\"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/pull/361\">#361</a>)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Extended English dictionary (english_extended.dic) has been removed to improve performance and reduce\n        plugin size.\n        (<a href=\"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/pull/352\">#352</a>)\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<b>New features</b>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <b>ðŸ”  Integer capitalization</b>.<br>\n        Option to change capitalization of Integers with base greater than 10.\n        For example, generate 0xFF instead of 0xff.\n        (<a href=\"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/issues/346\">#346</a>)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Short inline explanation of how dictionaries work in the Words settings dialog.\n        (<a href=\"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/issues/347\">#347</a>)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Improved support for drag-and-drop of dictionary files into dictionary table.\n        (<a href=\"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/issues/350\">#350</a>)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Improved error messages for IO failures with dictionaries.\n        (<a href=\"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/issues/354\">#354</a>)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Natural column widths in dictionary table.\n        (<a href=\"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/issues/354\">#354</a>)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Changes to dictionary contents are detected directly while in the Words settings dialog.\n        (<a href=\"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/issues/354\">#354</a>)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Invalid settings are marked as modified even if settings have not been changed.\n        (<a href=\"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/issues/354\">#354</a>)\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<b>Fixes</b>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Listing of data types in Randomness settings dialog has been fixed.\n        (<a href=\"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness/issues/341\">#341</a>)\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nChange notes of previous updates can be found on the\n<a href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9836-randomness/versions\">plugin repository</a>.\n","dependencies":["com.intellij.modules.platform"],"since":"201.0","sourceCodeUrl":"https://github.com/FWDekker/intellij-randomness","size":2193485}
